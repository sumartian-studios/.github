# Contributing

Hi there! Thank you for wanting to contribute to Sumartian Studios.

Before we can accept your contribution, please make sure that you have followed our development guidelines. By adhering to our organization's standards you can ensure that your contributions are accepted as quickly as possible.

## Style Guide

You should use common sense and reference the accompanying documentation for project specific guidelines.

## Pull Requests

We follow a common pattern for pull requests on Github:

- You fork the repository
- You clone your own fork and perform the build steps
- You make changes
- You submit a pull request (ideally linking to a relevant issue if one exists)

## Legal Agreements

Each repository has its own licensing terms. Our custom branding information like logos or other artwork do not share the licenses used by source code unless explicitly specified otherwise. The same goes for documentation or the books. You will need to ask for our permission before using any such files (i.e. you may not misrepresent our products as your own).
